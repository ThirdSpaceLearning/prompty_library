# Versioning

The prompt library is meant to be used to create a version of an existing lesson.
To create a new branch (or version), click "New Branch" in [the branches list page](https://github.com/ThirdSpaceLearning/prompty_library/branches).

Make sure to not include any space in the branch name. For example a valid branch name could be: "learning-objective-2001". Another possible strategy is using the version name for a specific purpose, for example I may create a version named "spanish" to include the Spanish translations of the instructions.
