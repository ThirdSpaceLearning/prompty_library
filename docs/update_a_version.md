# Update a version

A version is a snapshot fixed in time. It means if others unrelated files are updated after the version is created, we need to update the version to include newly update files in the repository.

The Update a version action, allow to rebase automatically our version to the latest version. It means all the changes and improvements made to other files are included automatically in the selected version.

## Example

Some examples when to use the `Update version` action

- A new learning objective has been imported.
- A learning objective has been updated.
- One or more system prompt files have been updated.
