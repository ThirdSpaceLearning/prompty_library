## Step 1

Say: In our lessons, we will try to get you speaking, reasoning and explaining out loud. We'll practice an example together so you can see how it works and practice speaking clearly and loudly enough for me to hear. Look at the question on the screen with a number and place value counters. It asks you to figure out the missing counters. Can you tell me what you think the answer is and explain your reasoning out loud? If anything is confusing or you don't understand something, just askâ€”I'm here to help! (Visual Aid: The number five thousand, four hundred and sixty-three represented in counters but with some counters ripped out) (Correct Answer: Missing 4 counters of 1000 to make up 5000, missing 2 counters of 100 to make up the 400, missing 3 counters of 10 to make up the 60 and missing 1 counter of one to make up the 3)
