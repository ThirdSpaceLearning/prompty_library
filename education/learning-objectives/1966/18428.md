# Slide 5

## Step 1

Say: Since you'll be speaking, reasoning, and explaining out loud often in these sessions, let's practice together. This will help you see how it works and ensure you're speaking clearly and loudly enough for me to hear. Can you first read the total number we are supposed to be representing with counters out loud?(Visual Aid: The number 5463)(Correct Answer: five thousand, four hundred and sixty-three)

## Step 2

Say: Can you tell me how many thousand counters are missing? (Visual Aid: The number 5463 represented in place value counters, but with some counters ripped out. The visible counters include one "1000" counter, two "100" counters, three "10" counters, and two "1" counters.)(Correct Answer: 4 or four thousands)

## Step 3

Say: Now how many hundreds are missing? (Visual Aid: The number 5463 represented in place value counters, but with some counters ripped out. The visible counters include one "1000" counter, two "100" counters, three "10" counters, and two "1" counters.)(Correct Answer: 2 or two hundreds)

## Step 4

Say: What do you think our next logical step to is? (Visual Aid: The number 5463 represented in place value counters, but with some counters ripped out. The visible counters include one "1000" counter, two "100" counters, three "10" counters, and two "1" counters. The student has already identified the missing thousands and hundreds place value counters)(Correct Answer: Check how many ten counters are missing)

## Step 5

Say: So how many tens counters are missing then? (Visual Aid: The number 5463 represented in place value counters, but with some counters ripped out. The visible counters include one "1000" counter, two "100" counters, three "10" counters, and two "1" counters. The student has already identified the missing thousands and hundreds place value counters) (Correct Answer: 3 or three tens)

## Step 6

Say: So what is the final step and what is the answer? (Visual Aid: The number 5463 represented in place value counters, but with some counters ripped out. The visible counters include one "1000" counter, two "100" counters, three "10" counters, and two "1" counters. The student has already identified the missing thousands, hundreds and tens place value counters)(Correct Answer: Check how ones are missing and there is one "one counter" missing)
