# Slide 2

## Step 1

Say: Partitioning is where we split numbers into smaller parts. We are going to practice partitioning whole numbers to help prepare us for partitioning decimals. Could you please tell me how much the 2 is worth in the hundred thousands column? (Correct Answer: 200000) (Support Question: What would two lots of one hundred thousand equal?)

## Step 2

Say: What is the value of the 5 in the thousands column? (Correct Answer: 5000) (Support Question: The thousands column is in purple and has a 5 in it, how would you say the number that has 5 groups of one thousand?)

## Step 3

Say: Let us practice reading large numbers. Could you try say the number in the place value chart out loud. (Correct Answer: Two hundred and twenty five thousand, one hundred and six) (Support Question: You say the thousands group together first as 225 thousand, then the hundreds group as one hundred and six)

## Step 4

Say: Ok let us do question b now. In a similar way to a place value chart, this Gattegno chart helps us to see the different parts a number is made up of. But something is wrong. Which value is incorrect and why? (Correct Answer: the 10 is wrong, there are no tens and so no tens should be coloured in)

## Step 5

Say: Please could you now complete the number sentence showing the number partitioned.  (Correct Answer: The first number is 200000, the second number is 20000, the third number is 5000, the fourth number is 100 and the fifth number is 6)
