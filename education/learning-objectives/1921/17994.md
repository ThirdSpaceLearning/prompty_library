## Step 1

Say: Let us now practice some questions that take this on a bit. Please work with me step by step so I can check your answers as we go along. For question a, please fill in the number represented by the counters in the top circle or the part-whole model. (Visual Aid: the number 1.36 represented in counters and a part whole model with top circle empty to add the value)(Correct Answer: 1.36)

## Step 2

Say: Now fill in the missing part. (Visual Aid: the number 1.36 represented in counters and a part whole model with an empty circle to add the value)(Correct Answer: 1.26)
(Support Question: For the missing part, think about which place value column is different)

## Step 3

Say: For question b, please complete the missing number in the first part-whole model. (Visual Aid: A part whole model with 2.98 as the whole, one part at 2.9 and one missing part)(Correct Answer: 0.08)(Support Question: If you already have 2.9, what more do you need to get to 2.98)

## Step 4

Say: What is the missing number in the last part-whole model. (Visual Aid: A part whole model with 0.25 as the whole, one part at 0.22 and one missing part)(Correct Answer: 0.03)
