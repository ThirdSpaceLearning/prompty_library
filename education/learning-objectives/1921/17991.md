# Slide 3

## Step 1

Say: Decimals can be partitioned, or split into smaller parts, in the same way that whole numbers can. Let us practice doing this. Please write the number that the counters show (Correct Answer: 53.42)

## Step 2

Say: Now please tell me how you would say this number out loud? (Visual Aid: 53.42)(Correct Answer: fifty-three point four two)(Support Question: We say the numbers after the point separately. Can you give it another go?)

## Step 3

Say: For question b, we are going to partition the number using a part-whole model. Please fill in the orange circle with the value of the 5 in the number. (Visual Aid: a part whole model with 53.42 split into 4 circles. The first orange circle represents the tens and is empty)(Correct Answer: 50)

## Step 4

Say: Now fill in the blue circle with the value of the 4 in the number.(Visual Aid: a part whole model with 53.42 split into 4 circles. The third blue circle represents the tenths and is empty) (Correct Answer: 0.4) (Support question: The value is a decimal representing how many tenths there are) 

## Step 5

Say: Now fill in the last circle with the value of the 2 in the number.(Visual Aid: a part whole model with 53.42 split into 4 circles. The last yellow circle represents the hundredths and is empty) (Correct Answer: 0.02) (Support question: The value is a decimal representing how many hundredths there are)
