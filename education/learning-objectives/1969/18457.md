## Step 3

Say: Please select the line that is half way between 6.2 and 6.3? (Correct Answer: The number 6.25)

## Step 4

Say: So is the number 6.24 more than or less than halfway? (Correct Answer: Less than halfway) (Visual Aid: Asking if 6.24 is more or less than halfway which is 6.25)

## Step 5

Say: So please write down if the number 6.24 would round down to 6.2 or up to 6.3? (Correct Answer: Rounds down to 6.2) (Visual Aid: A sentence asking if the number 6.24 rounds down to 6.2 or up to 6.3)
