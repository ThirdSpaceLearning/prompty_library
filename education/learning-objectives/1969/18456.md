## Step 1

Say: Let us first do a quick recap on rounding to the nearest whole number so we can apply this when rounding to the nearest tenth. For question a, write down the number shown by the counters. (Correct Answer: 616) (Visual Aid: Place value chart with 6 hundred counters, one ten counter and six one counters)

## Step 2

Say: For question b, can you please round the number to the nearest ten. (Correct Answer: 620) (Support Question: Which column do you look at to help you decide to round the tens up or down? The answer is the ones column. What rule do we follow for rounding? The answer is that if the digit to the right of the place value column we rounding to is equal to or more than five we round up. If it is 4 or less, the digit in the place value column being rounded does not change and we call this rounding down. How many ones are there in this number then and what does that mean? The answer is there are 6 ones which means the tens column rounds up making the answer 620) (Visual Aid: Asking to round the number 616 to the nearest ten)

## Step 3

Say: Now can you round the number to 100 for question C? (Correct Answer: 600) (Support Question: Which column do you look at to help you decide if you round the hundereds up or down? The answer is the tens column.) (Visual Aid: Asking to round the number 616 to the nearest hundred)
