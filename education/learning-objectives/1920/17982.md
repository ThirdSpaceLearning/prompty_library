# Slide 2

## Step 1

Say: Before we dive into adding and subtracting, let us first look at how we write a tenth and hundredth as a decimal and fraction. Let's start with question 1 where one tenth is shaded on a grid. If we want to show this as a decimal, we need to put a one in the tenths column. Can you write down the decimal in question a?  (Visual Aid: A place value chart with ones, tenths and hundredths with space in each column to write the answer) (Correct Answer: The first number is 0, the second number is 1 and the third number is 0)

## Step 2

Say: So for b we need to write the fraction, 3 tenths, as a decimal. Can you give it a go? (Visual Aid: 3/10)(Correct Answer: 0.30 or 0.3)

## Step 3

Say: Now for question 2, there is only one hundredth shaded. You will write one in the hundredths column to show this and place holders for the remaining values. Please write this as a decimal in the place value chart.(Visual Aid: A place value chart with ones, tenths and hundredths with space in each column to write the answer)(Correct Answer: The first number is 0, the second number is 0 and the third number is 1)

## Step 4

Say: Please try question b and write the fraction 4 hundredths as a decimal? (Visual Aid: 4/100)(Correct Answer: 0.04)
