## Step 1

Say: Before we dive into adding and subtracting, let us first look at how we write a tenth and hundredth as a decimal and fraction. Let's start with question 1 where one tenth is shaded on a grid. If we want to show this as a decimal, we need to put a one in the tenths column and place holders for the rest of the values. Can you write down the decimal for this in question a?  (Visual Aid: A place value chart with ones, tenths and hundredths with space in each column to write the answer) (Correct Answer: 0.1 or 0.10)

## Step 2

Say: So now instead of one tenth, could you write the fraction 3 tenths, as a decimal for b? (Visual Aid: 3/10)(Correct Answer: 0.30 or 0.3)

## Step 3

Say: For question 2, there is only one hundredth shaded. You will write one in the hundredths column to show this and place holders for the remaining values. Please write this as a decimal for b. (Visual Aid: A place value chart with ones, tenths and hundredths with space in each column to write the answer)(Correct Answer: 0.01)

## Step 4

Say: Please try question b and write the fraction 4 hundredths as a decimal? (Visual Aid: 4/100)(Correct Answer: 0.04)
