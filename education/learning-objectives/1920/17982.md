# Slide 2

## Step 1

Say: We're going to learn how to write numbers with decimals by understanding the value of each number after the decimal point. For question 1, could you tell me how much of the whole is shaded? (Visual Aid: A hundreds square with one out of ten rows shaded.)(Correct Answer: One tenth)

## Step 2

Say: We are now going to write the decimal number on a place value chart in part a as zero point one zero. The zero in the ones column shows us that we do not have a whole shaded, a one in the tenths column shows us we have 1 tenth and then a zero in the hundredths column shows us we have no hundredths. (Write: 0 @ PL_1_a).

## Step 3

Say: Can you now try and write 3 tenths in question b as a decimal? (Visual Aid: 3/10)(Correct Answer: 0.30 or 0.3)

## Step 4

Say: For question 2, since no full whole is shaded, we once again write zero in the ones column. There aren't any tenths shaded so we write zero in the tenths column but as there is one hundredth shaded, we write one in the hundredths column. This give us the number 0.01 which is smaller than 0.10 from above.

## Step 5

Say: Please try and write 4 hundredths in question b as a decimal? (Visual Aid: 4/100)(Correct Answer: 0.04)
