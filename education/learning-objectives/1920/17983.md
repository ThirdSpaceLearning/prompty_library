## Step 1

Say: Now let's learn about adding and subtracting with tenths and hundredths by using part-whole model and place value charts. Please break up 3.42 into three parts and put each number in a circle for question a. (Visual Aid: A part-whole model consisting of the whole being the top circle with the number 3.42 at the top, there are three empty circles below to put the answers in). (Correct Answer: 3, 0.4, 0.02.)

## Step 2

Say: Now look at the second place value chart and fill in the part-whole model for this number. (Visual Aid: Part-whole model with 3 circles, and below is a place value chart with 3 counters in the ones column, no counters in the tenths column and 2 counters in the hundredths column). (Correct Answer: 3.02, 3 and 0.02)

## Step 3

Say: Can you tell me what has changed between the two decimal numbers in a and then write that down as a calculation in question b. (Visual Aid: a calculation to fill in which is 3.42 - ? = ?) (Correct Answer: The first number is 0.4 and second number is 3.02) (Next Slide: 5)
