## Step 1

Say: Now let's learn about adding and subtracting with tenths and hundredths by using part-whole models. For question a, please partition the number 3.42 by completing the three circles with wholes, tenths and hundredths. (Visual Aid: A part-whole model consisting of the whole being the top circle with the number 3.42 at the top, there are three empty circles below to put the answers in). (Correct Answer: 3, 0.4, 0.02.)

## Step 2

Say: Now for the second part of a, please complete the part-whole model with the number you see in the place value chart below. (Visual Aid: Part-whole model with 3 circles, and below is a place value chart with 3 counters in the ones column, no counters in the tenths column and 2 counters in the hundredths column). (Correct Answer: 3.02, 3 and 0.02)

## Step 3

Say: So something has changed to the number 3.42 to get 3.02. Could you show this by completing the calucation in question b. (Visual Aid: a calculation to fill in which is 3.42 - ? = ?) (Correct Answer: The first number is 0.4 and second number is 3.02)
