6Say: Here you can see the same counters shown in a hundreds square.

1.  Ask: If we have two tenths, how many strips of ten do we have?
2.  Check answer: 2 strips of ten
3.  Say: So we write this as 0.2, showing that we have two groups of ten
    in the tenths column.
4.  Ask: If the green counters total is 4 hundredths, how many hundredth
    squares do I have?
5.  Check answer: 4 hundred
6.  Say: So we write that we have four hundredths in the hundredths
    column as 0.04.
7.  Ask: How would you say the the decimal together?
8.  Check answer: zero point two four. If the student says zero point
    twenty-four then explain that we say each place value after the
    point separately to show how many we have in each position.
9.  Move to position 6.
