# Slide 5

1.  Say: Here you can see the same counters shown in a hundreds square.
2.  Ask: If we have two tenths, how many strips of ten do we have?
3.  Check answer: 2 strips of ten
4.  Say: So we write this as 0.2, showing that we have two groups of ten
    in the tenths column.
5.  Ask: If the green counters total is 4 hundredths, how many hundredth
    squares do I have?
6.  Check answer: 4 hundred
7.  Say: So we write that we have four hundredths in the hundredths
    column as 0.04.
8.  Ask: How would you say the the decimal together?
9.  Check answer: zero point two four. If the student says zero point
    twenty-four then explain that we say each place value after the
    point separately to show how many we have in each position.
10. Move to position 6.
