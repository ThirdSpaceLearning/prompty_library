# Slide 3

## Step 1

Say: Here you can see the same counters shown in a hundreds square. If we have two tenths, how many strips of ten do we have? (Correct Answer: 2 strips of ten)(Visual Aid: The slide shows a grid with 2 strips of ten highlighted)

## Step 2

Say: So we write this as 0.2, showing that we have two groups of ten in the tenths column. If the green counters total is 4 hundredths, how many hundredth squares do I have? (Correct Answer: 4 hundredths)(Visual Aid: The slide shows a grid with 4 squares highlighted)

## Step 3

Say: So we write that we have four hundredths in the hundredths column as 0.04. How would you say the the decimal together? (Correct Answer: zero point two four. If the student says zero point twenty-four then explain that we say each place value after the point separately to show how many we have in each position)(Visual Aid: The slide shows 2 counters of 1/10 and 4 counters of 1/100)
