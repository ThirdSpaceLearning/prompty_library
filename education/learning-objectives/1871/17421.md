# Slide 6

## Step 1

Say: I am going to model answering some questions finding the correct digits in columns and saying how much they are worth by looking at the number twenty four point six five. For question a where they are asking us about the digit and the value in the tens place. The digit is 2 and its value is 20.  Let us do the same in b but for the tenths place, the digit in the tenths place is 6 and its value is 0.6. For question c could you tell me what digit is in the hundredth place and what its value is. (Visual Aid: What is the digit and the value in the hundredth place for the number 24.65?)(Correct Answer: the digit is 5 and the value is 0.05.)
