## Step 1

Say: We are going to learn about the value of different digits and how the position of digits tells us how much it is worth. Could you write and say what the value is of the blue counters as a decimal number? (Visual Aid: The blue counters show both 1/10 as a fraction.)(Correct Answer: zero point two because two times 1/10 is equal to zero point two.)

## Step 2

Say: Now can you write and say what the value is of the green counters as a decimal? (Visual Aid: All the four green counters show 1/100 as a fraction.)(Correct Answer: zero point zero four.)(Support Slide: 3)

## Step 3

Say: Could you please explain if 2 tenths or 4 hundredths is bigger and why? (Correct Answer: zero point two because when we divide a whole into hundredths the size of each piece is ten times smaller than if we divide by ten.)

## Step 4

Say: Now in question b, please write the decimal of all the counters in a. (Visual Aid: Two blue counters of 1/10 each and 4 green counters of 1/100 each.)(Correct Answer: 0.24)

## Step 5

Say: Is the correct way to read this decimal as zero point twenty four or zero point two four? (Correct Answer: zero point two four as we read each number after the point separately to represent each place value.)(Next Slide: 4)
