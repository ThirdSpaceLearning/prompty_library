# Slide 2

## Step 1

Say: Let us now explore the position of digits in decimals and what this tells us about their values or how much they are worth. Please write the value of the blue counters as a decimal number?(Visual Aid: 2 blue counters of 1/10 each.)(Correct Answer: 0.2)(Support Question: If you write one tenth as 0.1 how would you write two tenths?)

## Step 2

Say: Now can you write and say what the value is of the green counters as a decimal?(Visual Aid: 4 green counters of 1/100 each)(Correct Answer: 0.04)(Support Question: If one hundredth is written as 0.01, how would you write four hundredths?)

## Step 3

Say: Could you please explain whether 0.2 or 0.04 is bigger and why?(Correct Answer: 0.2 is bigger because when we divide a whole into hundredths the size of each piece is ten times smaller than if we divide by ten. This makes 2 tenths actually equal to 20 hundredths so 0.2 is bigger than 0.04 which is just 4 hundredths)

## Step 4

Say: Now for question b, please write the decimal number represented by both blue and green counters above.(Visual Aid: Two blue counters of 1/10 each and 4 green counters of 1/100 each.)(Correct Answer: 0.24)

## Step 5

Say: Is the correct way to read this decimal as zero point twenty four or zero point two four?(Correct Answer: zero point two four as we read each number after the point separately to represent each place value.)
