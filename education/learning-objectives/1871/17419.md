## Step 1

Say: In this lesson, we will learn how to find the value of each digit in numbers up to two decimal places. This skill will help you understand and work with decimals better, helping you with things like working with money and measurements.
By the end of this lesson, you'll feel more confident reading, writing, and understanding decimal values. Let's start with the learning goal question you see on the screen. Could you please write the value of the digit 2 in this number?(Visual Aid: 35.28 with the 2 underlined)(Correct Answer: 0.2 or 2 tenths)

## Step 2

Say: Give the prior learning question a go now. Please use the circle tool and circle the greatest fraction.(Visual Aid: A question asking to decide if 7/10 or 6/100 is bigger)(Correct Answer: 7/10)
