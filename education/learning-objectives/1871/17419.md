## Step 1

Say: I'd like to start with asking you a question so I can figure out what you know about decimals and their values. Please look at the grid and can you tell me the correct decimal showing this? (Visual Aid: The question shows a 10x10 grid with 2 blocks of a different color.)(Correct Answer: b which is 0.02)(Support Slide: 4)

## Step 2

Say: Can you explain why the answer is 0.02. (Correct Answer: This is 2 hundredths and the second column after the decimal point is the position that indicates hundredths.)
