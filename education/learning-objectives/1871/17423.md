# Slide 9

Part 5 contains a 'Go further' section.

\

Explain that we are going to match statements to the correct decimal and
then ask the student to first start with statement a and write the
decimal that it matches to. Question a's answer should be 5.32 because
this number has a 2 in the hundredths place value column.

\

Then ask the student question b which asks which decimals have no
hundredths. The correct answers are 6.2 and 61.4

\

Then ask the student question c which is which decimal has 6 tenths in
it. The answer is 1.68 . A possible error by the student could be
mistakenly choosing 61.4 thinking of tens instead of tenths.

\

Once that is complete, recap the main learning point, say goodbye and
end the session.
