# Slide 9

1. Say: We are going to match statements to the correct decimal.
2. Ask: First start with statement a and write the decimal that it matches to. Question a's answer should be 5.32 because this number has a 2 in the hundredths place value column.
3. Ask: question b is which decimals have no hundredths.
4. Check answer: The correct answers are 6.2 and 61.4
5. Ask: question c is which decimal has 6 tenths in it. The answer is 1.68. A possible error by the student could be mistakenly choosing 61.4 thinking of tens instead of tenths.
6. Recap the main learning point, say goodbye and end the session.
