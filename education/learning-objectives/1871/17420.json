  {
    "Ask": "Could you please explain whether 0.2 or 0.04 is bigger and why?",
    "Correct Idea": "0.2 is bigger because when we divide a whole into hundredths the size of each piece is ten times smaller than if we divide by ten. This makes 2 tenths actually equal to 20 hundredths so 0.2 is bigger than 0.04 which is just 4 hundredths",
