## Step 1

Say: Let's start with whole numbers to get comfortable. First off, finding the halfway point helps us better estimate, please fill in half of 100000 in question a. (Correct Answer: 50000)(Support Question: If you think of 100 instead of 100,000, what is half of 100? Now, make that a thousand times bigger)

## Step 2

Say: Next we think about the interval sizes. If 100,000 is divided into 10 intervals, then each of those jumps is equal to 1000. What would the value of b and c be then? (Correct Answer: The first number is 20000 and the second number is 90000)

## Step 3

Say: Now for the next step we need to figure out what each small interval is equal to which is 1000 divided by ten. What is each small jump equal to then? (Correct Answer: 1000)

## Step 4

Say: Please complete the size of d, e and f. (Correct Answer: The fist number is 9000, the second number is 37000 and the third number is 91000) (Visual Aid: A number line divided into 100 intervals starting at 0 and ending at 100000. An arrow d is pointing to the 9th interval, an arrow e is pointing to the 37th interval and an arrow f is pointing to the 91st interval)
