## Step 1

Say: In this section we are going to estimate positions of decimals on a number line where we can't see the smaller intervals. The number line is from 0 to 1 with ten intervals. So each interval is one tenth. In question a we zoom into one interval and could you tell me what value is on each side of this? (Correct Answer: The first number is 0.6 and the second number is 0.7)

## Step 2

Say: The arrow points halfway between these two intervals. If we divide each tenth into ten more parts, each smaller line represents a hundredth. How many hundredths is the arrow pointing to? (Correct Answer: 0.05 or 5 hundredths)

## Step 3

Say: Now we have enough information to estimate where the arrow is pointing to in the first number line. Please write the answer. (Correct Answer: 0.65) (Support Question: We know that it is 0.05 past the interval showing 0.6. So we add these two numbers together)
