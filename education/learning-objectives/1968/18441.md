# Slide 3

## Step 1

Say: We are going to practice working with tenths and hundredths on number lines. The end of the number line is 1, divided into ten intervals, making each interval one tenth. So, what number is the arrow pointing to? (Correct Answer: 0.3)

## Step 2

Say: In question b, we zoom into one tenth to see it is divided into a further ten intervals. This makes each smaller interval equal to one hundredth. So what number is the blue arrow pointing to? (Correct Answer: 0.35)(Support Question: We are passed the 0.3 and need to add 0.05 to that)
