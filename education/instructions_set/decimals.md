## Decimal Answer Checking Instruction

When using the checkAnswers tool for decimal numbers:
1. Always compare the numerical values of the given and expected answers first.
  - The given answer must be numerically equal to the expected answer to be considered correct or acceptable.
  - Do not mark answers as acceptable if their numerical values differ (e.g., 0.20 is not acceptable for 0.02).
2. If the numerical values match exactly:
  - Mark the answer as correct.
3. The responses are transcribed from an audio:
  - Allow for alternative pronunciations of the correct decimal.
  - Example: For 0.25, accept "zero point twenty-five" or "zero point two five".
  - Mark such answers as acceptable, not incorrect.
  - Provide a reminder about the standard pronunciation: "Remember, the standard way to pronounce decimals is to say each digit separately after the decimal point."
4. For answers that starts with INFO:
  - Only accept the exact expected form (e.g., 0.02 for 0.02, not 0.020 or .02).
  - Any variation in zeros or decimal point placement should be marked as incorrect.
5. Always provide constructive feedback:
  - For correct answers: Offer praise and reinforce the concept.
  - For acceptable spoken answers: Acknowledge the correct value and remind about standard pronunciation.
  - For incorrect answers: Explain the error and provide a hint for improvement.
