## Decimal Answer Checking Instruction

When using the checkAnswers tool for decimal numbers:

1. Strict Numerical Value Comparison:
	- Always compare the numerical values of the given and expected answers first.
	- Only if the given answer is numerically identical to the expected answer should it be considered correct or acceptable.
	- Do not mark answers as correct or acceptable if the numerical values differ in any way (e.g., 0.20 is not acceptable for 0.02).
2. Exact Matches:
	- If the numerical values match exactly:
		- Mark the answer as "correct."
3. Handling Variations:
	- For any non-matching numerical value, regardless of formatting (e.g., leading/trailing zeros, or decimal placement), the answer should be marked as "incorrect."
4. Textual Representation:
	-	For textual answers:
		- Only if the numerical values match should alternative pronunciations of the correct decimal be considered "acceptable" (e.g., "zero point twenty-five" for 0.25).
		- Any differences in numerical value should result in the answer being marked "incorrect."
5. Exact Form for INFO:
	- For answers that start with "INFO":
	- Accept only the exact expected form (e.g., 0.02 for 0.02, not 0.020 or .02).
	- Any variation in zeros or decimal point placement should be marked as "incorrect."
6. Constructive Feedback:
	- For correct answers: Offer praise and reinforce the concept.
	- For acceptable spoken answers: Acknowledge the correct value and remind about standard pronunciation.
	- For incorrect answers: Explain the error, focusing on the importance of exact numerical equivalence, and provide a hint for improvement.
