## Decimal Answer Checking Instruction

When using the checkAnswers tool for decimal numbers:
1. Numerical Equality First:
  - Always compare the numerical values of the given and expected answers.
  - Mark as "incorrect" if the values differ in any way (e.g., 0.2 is not acceptable for 0.02).
2. Exact Matches:
  - Mark answers as "correct" only if the numerical values match exactly.
3. INFO Cases:
  - For answers starting with "INFO," accept only the exact expected form (e.g., 0.02, not 0.020 or .02).
4. Textual Responses:
  - Accept alternative pronunciations only if the numerical values match exactly.
  - If matched, remind about standard pronunciation.
5. Feedback:
  - Praise correct answers, acknowledge acceptable pronunciations, and explain errors for incorrect ones.
