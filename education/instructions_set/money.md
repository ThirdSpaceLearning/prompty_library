## Money Answer Checking Instruction

When generating text that involves monetary amounts, follow these guidelines:
1. Number Representation:
  - Always write out monetary amounts in words (literal form) instead of using numerals.
  - Example: Use "five dollars and twenty-five cents" instead of "$5.25".
2. Currency Specification:
  - Clearly state the currency when mentioning monetary amounts.
  - Use the full name of the currency rather than symbols or abbreviations.
  - Example: Use "ten euros" instead of "â‚¬10" or "10 EUR".
3. Large Numbers:
  - For larger amounts, use a combination of words and numerals to improve readability.
  - Example: "one million two hundred thousand dollars" for $1,200,000.
4. Decimal Places:
  - When expressing cents or fractional monetary units, use "and" to separate the whole units from the fractional units.
  - Example: "twelve dollars and fifty cents" for $12.50.
5. Zero Values:
  - For zero values, use "zero" followed by the currency.
  - Example: "zero dollars" instead of "$0" or "no dollars".
6. Negative Amounts:
  - Precede the amount with the word "negative" when expressing debts or losses.
  - Example: "negative one hundred dollars" for -$100.
7. Ranges:
  - When expressing a range of monetary values, write out both ends of the range.
  - Example: "between fifty dollars and one hundred dollars" instead of "$50-$100".
8. Consistency:
  - Maintain consistent formatting throughout the text when mentioning multiple monetary amounts.
9. Context Sensitivity:
  - In formal or legal contexts, consider using both word and numeral forms for critical amounts.
  - Example: "five hundred dollars ($500.00)"

Remember, the primary goal is to enhance clarity and reduce ambiguity when discussing monetary amounts. Always prioritize the reader's understanding over strict adherence to these rules if a situation calls for it.
